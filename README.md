[Humap](https://humap-app.herokuapp.com/) is a web app which aims to digitalize how societies interact within themselves by providing an easy interface to communicate which can result in creating better versions of themselves.

## Why We Built This
Back in the days, society used to be tighly linked and knew everything about each other, they used to communicate very well with each other and this made societies
capable of solving many issues effeciently. Nowadays, despite the increase in the number of issues persisting in society, society has grown apart and due to the ongoing pandemic, it seems as if even neighbours are in a long-distance relationship.

That's why we made this app, to help societies be together closely despite all the distance between us right now and to help societies work on improving themselves by openly talking about issues and coming up with solutions.

## Working
We allow the user to make posts along with a tag from his/her/their location and this post along with each post is saved along with the location in MongoDB Atlas DB. The user can also view posts in an area (within 2kms of the location pointed by the user) by using the interactive map and pointing to which location's post he/she/they want to see.

## Technologies Used
1. MongoDB along with Mongoose
2. ExpressJS
3. React
4. NodeJS
5. Mapbox

## Challenges We Faced
1. Finding a map api which was free and which worked well with React was quite a tough task
2. Git Workflow
3. There's pain after breakup and then there is debugging NodeJS

## Additional Notes
- Want to play around with the code and make changes to it yourself? Well **checkout** the `development` branch of this repo.
- Try changing browsers (to Mozilla Firefox) if some parts of the site are too big/small. So in other words, it's not that our website is not responsive........it's your browser's fault <3
